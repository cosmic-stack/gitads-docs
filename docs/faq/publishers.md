### ❓ What is GitAds?
GitAds is an ad network specifically designed for GitHub repositories. It enables developers to monetize their open-source work by displaying relevant, developer-focused ads in their repositories while maintaining the integrity of their projects.

### ❓ How much can I earn?
Earnings vary based on repository traffic, engagement, and ad performance. Earnings are calculated based on impressions (CPM) and clicks (CPC).

### ❓ Is verification mandatory?
Yes, repository verification is mandatory for security reasons. This ensures that only legitimate repository owners can display ads and receive payments. The verification process is simple and takes just a few minutes.

### ❓ Can I remove the verification code later?
Yes. Once your repository is verified, you can safely remove the verification code from your README. The verification status will remain active unless you transfer repository ownership.

### ❓ Do I need to complete KYC?
Yes. All publishers must complete Know Your Customer (KYC) verification to receive payments. This typically takes less than 10 minutes and requires:
- Government-issued ID
- Proof of address
- Basic personal/business information

### ❓ How do I get paid?
Payments are processed monthly when your earnings reach the minimum threshold ($50). We support multiple payment methods:
- PayPal
<!-- - Bank transfer (SWIFT/SEPA) -->
Payments are typically sent within the first 10 days of each month.

### ❓ Can I add multiple repositories?
Yes. You can add and verify multiple repositories from your dashboard. Each repository can have its own ad placement and will contribute to your total earnings. There's no limit to the number of repositories you can monetize.

### ❓ Can I control which ads appear?
Currently, you cannot directly control individual ads, but we ensure all ads are:
- Developer-focused and relevant
- Non-intrusive and professionally designed
- Screened for quality and appropriateness
A publisher approval system is coming soon where you can whitelist specific ad categories or advertisers.

### ❓ Where should I place the ads?
Ads perform best when placed:
- Near the top of your README.md
- In visible documentation sections
- Above the fold in high-traffic pages
We recommend maintaining a balance between visibility and user experience.

### ❓ What if my repository is transferred or archived?
- Repository transfers: You'll need to re-verify ownership
- Archived repositories: Ads will automatically pause
- Organization transfers: Contact support for assistance

### ❓ How do you handle ad blockers?
GitAds is designed to be minimally affected by ad blockers because:
- Ads are served via GitHub's CDN
- Ad content is markdown-based
- No external JavaScript is required
However, some impression/click tracking may be affected.

### ❓ What about repository forks?
Ads only appear in your verified repository, not in forks. This ensures you maintain control over monetization and prevents unauthorized ad displays.

### ❓ Can I use GitAds with private repositories?
No, GitAds currently only works with public repositories. This ensures maximum visibility and fair earnings calculations.

### ❓ How is ad revenue calculated?
Revenue is calculated based on:
<!-- - Impressions (CPM - Cost Per Mille) -->
- Clicks (CPC - Cost Per Click)
- Geographic location of visitors
- Engagement rates
<!-- - Advertiser bids -->

### ❓ What happens if I violate the terms?
Violations of our terms of service may result in:
- Temporary suspension of ads
- Account review
- Payment holds
We'll always communicate issues and provide opportunity to resolve them.
