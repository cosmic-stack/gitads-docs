## Step 3: Create Your First Ad

### Ad Content Requirements

- **Images:** Various Dimensions in PNG or JPG format.
- **Headline:** The title of the ad.

2. Upload your ad image
3. Enter your headline
4. Add your destination URL with proper UTM parameters for tracking
5. Add tags/Categories that best suits your ad (Max 3)
